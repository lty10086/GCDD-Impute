# GCDD-Impute
Our experiments use Python 3.10 and R 4.0 for data analysis and processing. For deep learning tasks, we used PyTorch version 2.3.1 CPU. All software environments were managed through Anaconda, ensuring consistency of configuration and reproducibility of experiments.The single-cell data in the.Csv file before and after imputation are listed in genes as rows and cells as columns.
